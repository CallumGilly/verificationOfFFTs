   abstract = {This paper addresses the formal specification and verification of fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms at different abstraction levels based on the HOL theorem prover. We make use of existing theories in HOL on real and complex numbers, IEEE standard floating-point, and fixed-point arithmetics to model the FFT algorithms. Then, we derive, by proving theorems in HOL, expressions for the accumulation of roundoff error in floating- and fixed-point FFT designs with respect to the corresponding ideal real and complex numbers specification. The HOL formalization and proofs are found to be in good agreement with the theoretical paper-and-pencil counterparts. Finally, we use a classical hierarchical proof approach in HOL to prove that the FFT implementations at the register transfer level (RTL) implies the corresponding high level fixed-point algorithmic specification.},

Agda is based on Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory but extends it with numerous programming language features. It supports a wide range of inductive data types, including inductive families and inductive-recursive types, with associated flexible pattern-matching. Unlike other proof assistants , Agda is not tactic-based. Instead it has an Emacs-based interface which allows programming by gradual refinement of incomplete type-correct terms.},

   abstract = {We program the Fast Fourier Transform in type theory, using the tool Coq. We prove its correctness and the correctness of the Inverse Fourier Transform. A type of trees representing vectors with interleaved elements is defined to facilitate the definition of the transform by structural recursion. We define several operations and proof tools for this data structure, leading to a simple proof of correctness of the algorithm. The inverse transform, on the other hand, is implemented on a different representation of the data, that makes reasoning about summations easier. The link between the two data types is given by an isomorphism. This work is an illustration of the two-level approach to proof development and of the principle of adapting the data representation to the specific algorithm under study. CtCoq, a graphical user interface of Coq, helped in the development. We discuss the characteristics and usefulness of this tool.},

   abstract = {Dependently typed languages have for a long time been used to describe proofs about programs. Traditionally, dependent types are used mostly for stating and proving the properties of the programs and not in defining the programs themselves. An impressive example is the certified compiler by Leroy (2006) implemented and proved correct in Coq (Bertot and Castéran 2004).Recently there has been an increased interest in dependently typed programming, where the aim is to write programs that use the dependent type system to a much higher degree. In this way a lot of the properties that were previously proved separately can be integrated in the type of the program, in many cases adding little or no complexity to the definition of the program. New languages, such as Epigram (McBride and McKinna 2004), are being designed, and existing languages are being extended with new features to accomodate these ideas, for instance the work on dependently typed programming in Coq by Sozeau (2007).This talk gives an overview of the Agda programming language (Norell 2007), whose main focus is on dependently typed programming. Agda provides a rich set of inductive types with a powerful mechanism for pattern matching, allowing dependently typed programs to be written with minimal fuss. To read about programming in Agda, see the lecture notes from the Advanced Functional Programming summer school (Norell 2008) and the work by Oury and Swierstra (2008).In the talk a number of examples of interesting dependently typed programs chosen from the domain of programming language implementation are presented as they are implemented in Agda.},

   abstract = {Papers on functional language implementations frequently set the goal of achieving performance "comparable to C", and sometimes report results comparing benchmark results to concrete C implementations of the same problem. A key pair of questions for such comparisons is: what C program to compare to, and what C compiler to compare with? In a 2012 paper, Satish et al [9] compare naive serial C implementations of a range of throughput-oriented benchmarks to best-optimized implementations parallelized on a six-core machine and demonstrate an average 23X (up to 53X) speedup. Even accounting for thread parallel speedup, these results demonstrate a substantial performance gap between naive and tuned C code. In this current paper, we choose a subset of the benchmarks studied by Satish et al to port to Haskell. We measure performance of these Haskell benchmarks compiled with the standard Glasgow Haskell Compiler and with our experimental Intel Labs Haskell Research Compiler and report results as compared to our best reconstructions of the algorithms used by Satish et al. Results are reported as measured both on an Intel Xeon E5-4650 32-core machine, and on an Intel Xeon Phi co-processor. We hope that this study provides valuable data on the concrete performance of Haskell relative to C.},

   abstract = {We present instance arguments: an alternative to type classes and related features in the dependently typed, purely functional programming language/proof assistant Agda. They are a new, general type of function arguments, resolved from call-site scope in a type-directed way. The mechanism is inspired by both Scala's implicits and Agda's existing implicit arguments, but differs from both in important ways. Our mechanism is designed and implemented for Agda, but our design choices can be applied to other programming languages as well.Like Scala's implicits, we do not provide a separate structure for type classes and their instances, but instead rely on Agda's standard dependently typed records, so that standard language mechanisms provide features that are missing or expensive in other proposals. Like Scala, we support the equivalent of local instances. Unlike Scala, functions taking our new arguments are first-class citizens and can be abstracted over and manipulated in standard ways. Compared to other proposals, we avoid the pitfall of introducing a separate type-level computational model through the instance search mechanism. All values in scope are automatically candidates for instance resolution. A final novelty of our approach is that existing Agda libraries using records gain the benefits of type classes without any modification.We discuss our implementation in Agda (to be part of Agda 2.2.12) and we use monads as an example to show how it allows existing concepts in the Agda standard library to be used in a similar way as corresponding Haskell code using type classes. We also demonstrate and discuss equivalents and alternatives to some advanced type class-related patterns from the literature and some new patterns specific to our system.},
