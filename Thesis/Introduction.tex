\section{Introduction}

The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a staple operation within Computer 
Science, Physics, and other fields with many applications.
Fast Fourier Transforms are implementations of the DFT with improved 
performance characteristics.
One such use of the FFT is polynomial multiplication, the time 
complexity of which can be reduced from $\mathcal{O}\left(n^2\right)$ to
$\mathcal{O}\left(n\log n\right)$.

Most current implementations, such as WFFT\cite{Frigo2005}, take the form of 
large libraries written in low-level languages. 
A key component of these libraries is the use of multiple implementations of 
the same algorithm, with each implementation (or kernel) containing 
optimisations suited towards specific input sizes and hardware profiles. 
When the user wants to compute the result of a Fourier Transform, the library 
chooses the optimal kernel based on the input size and the user's hardware.

The large number of kernels makes it very challenging to verify that a given 
FFT library provides the same result as the naïve DFT.
This is because to do so would involve analysing the low-level implementation 
of each kernel, individually, and proving that it gives the same result as the 
naïve DFT for all possible inputs.
An alternate approach is as follows. % This sentence doesn't add much, 
                                     % but I'm not sure that it flows too well 
                                     % without it
Instead of analysing existing code to confirm its correctness, we can create a 
single specification of the FFT such that it can be instantiated to any kernel, 
giving us a usable kernel and formal proof that said kernel computes the 
expected values.

Agda is a dependently typed functional language which allows for formal 
properties of programs written in it to be proven.\cite{Norell2007} 
This paper discusses the use of Agda to create a general case implementation 
of the FFT which is then proven to always compute the same value as the naïve 
DFT.

Such an implementation would allow for future research in Agda to make use of
the FFT in definitions, before substituting it with the DFT when it comes to
generating proofs.
This would be useful for research into algorithms which utilise the FFT, such as
efficient polynomial multiplication.
Such an implementation would also allow for future generation of low-level, 
efficient kernels, with a formally verified basis.
